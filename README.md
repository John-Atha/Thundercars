* Aim of the project 

The aim of the project is to create a Web Application for EV Charging. 
- - -
Our Web Application consists of the following parts:

`back-end`:
* It is responsible for the data management and the access to it through a REST API.
* It supports user management (sign up , log in , log out ) so that they can get access to the data through the API. 

`CLI(Command Line Interface)`:
The interface is used by the admins for data and users management and it will act us a client of the REST API.

`front-end`:
* Our web application will allow the user to view the data through diagrams, statistics and maps. 
* It works on a web browser environment and will actually be our REST API's second client.

* For the installation, follow the steps in the READMEs of each part.
